# [About](#about)
A Korean-American born and raised in NJ, obsessed with designing quality products. Although my background is primarily based on software-engineering, I'm often drawn towards the artistic elements of human-interface design and overall experience design. I graduated Fordham University with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2020.

Currently, I'm the founder of [Nanogram](https://www.nanogram.dev) — a software company that makes quality products that make you think magic is _real_. Our primary product, [Nanolens](https://www.nanolens.co/) takes self-expression to the next step by allowing you to control how you want your posts to be seen.

Previously, I was a co-founder of: Bucket (2018) — an events ticketing app for friends; Capsule (2017), an album-sharing app; Redplanet (2016), a social network that organized your newsfeeds. Other work experience includes NBCUniversal (2018) as a contracted SWE and Beep, or Unmute, Inc. (2018) as an iOS Engineer developer camera editing features.
